# Linear-Programming-IBM-CPLEX
An example of a linear programming which uses IBM CPLEX


1. PROBLEM (SOLUTION 150160510_1d.lp)

Maximize     Z = -2x1 + x2 - 4x3 + 3x4

Subject to:

x1 + x2 + 3x3 + 2x4 ≤ 4

x1 - x3 + x4 ≥-1

2x1 + x2 ≤ 2

x1 + 2x2 + x3 + 2x4 = 2

and x2 ≥ 0; x3 ≥ 0; x4 ≥ 0

No non-negativity constraint for x1.

2.PROBLEM (SOLUTION 150160510_2b.lp 150160510_2d.lp)

Northeastern Airlines is considering the purchase of new long, medium, and short-range jet airplanes. The purchase price would 
be $67 million for each long-range plane, $50 million for each  medium-range plane, and $35 million for each short-range plane. 
The board of directors has  authorized a maximum commitment of $1.5 billion for these purchases. Regardless of which   airplanes 
are purchased, air travel of all distances is expected to be sufficiently large that these  planes would be utilized at maximum capacity. 
It is estimated that the net annual profit (after capital recovery costs are subtracted) would be $4.2 million per long -range plane, $3 
million per medium range plane, and $2.3 million per short-range plane.
It is predicted that enough trained pilots will be available to the company to crew 30 new airplanes. If only short-range planes were 
purchased, the maintenance facilities would be able to handle 40 new planes. However, each medium-range plane is equivalent to 
1⅓ short-range planes, and each  long-range plane is equivalent to 1⅔ short-range planes in terms of their use of the maintenance
facilities.
Management wishes to know how many planes of each type should be purchased to maximize profit.
